## Why I want to learn about software engineering

Our society today heavily relies on computer-related technology.  Technology helps us from communication and time management to manufacturing and healthcare and many other things that have an enormous impact on our lives.  
As important as these technologies impact our lives and how it continues to evolve, there is also a worry and analysis about AI possibly taking our jobs in the future. There already is an AI in the customer service areas like the self-kiosk in markets and fast food places which takes the jobs of cashiers.  
There is an automated system which answers the phone on the call and answers the basic questions.  Nowadays AI can even draw for you or even have anyone's voice recorded and use that voice to recreate the song or have them sing with their voice they never sang before.  With these possible job replacements, choosing to learn programming sounded like the right choice for me since AI does not have its own creative thinking and deep principle understanding that humans bring to their work.   


I was always interested in playing video games, using phone applications and various websites.  Since I used various applications and these programs I started to take interest in programming and what caught my attention specially was software engineering because software engineering skills are what helps to create these applications, games and all the other things I'm interested in.  Because creative thinking is also essential for software engineering, I figured by learning about this programming language I can extend my knowledge and thoughts about programming in general and use them efficiently in the near future.


## What I hope to develop in future

Through taking software engineering I hope to develop multiple skills for my future needs.  Software engineering is known as designing and implementing programs and using different programming languages to help make those solutions widely available to users across different platforms.  By learning software engineering I hope in the future I will have comprehensive knowledge of programming and the way to design, with some engineering principles to build software.  Also I would want to improve on my creativity and flexibility on any real world questions I could use for my possible future career.
