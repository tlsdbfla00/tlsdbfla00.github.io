## First weekend of learning Typescript

Coding standards can actually help to learn a programming language because if everyone had a different style of coding, it would take time to review others code which is why having consistency will have a better readability where everyone can understand.  By having coding standards, it provides a structured way to write code, making it easier to read and understand. It could possibly help error reduction allowing us to focus on the language alone.   I believe by following these coding standards, we can enhance the learning experience when picking up a new programming language. 


## My impression of using ESLint with VSCode on a first week

On my first weekend of using ESLint with VSCode, I’ve noticed that I’ve been writing the code with wrong indentation and spaces. 
Getting rid of all these ESLint errors was enjoyable because it corrected me on how to write a better, consistent code with clear explanations on what was wrong with certain lines.
After removing all the errors, my code looked much more readable and understandable to others.  So far I’ve had good experience using ESLint with VScode on how convenient it is.  Overall, coding standards can efficiently develop our programming skills.
