## Learning HTML and CSS

Learning module UI Frameworks (Basics) was like learning a new programming language to me.  When I first started learning HTML and CSS using FreeCodeCamp, I could understand what they were guiding but I would have to go back each time to remember what they were since there were lots of things to learn in a short amount of time. It was also confusing for me as to using HTML elements correctly on different type of situation.
Then we were introduced to Bootstrap 5 to help maintain our code with consistency.  Bootstrap 5 helped us to structure our code to build UI and make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.  By investing time on Bootstrap 5 we can have a consistent Code Structure where Frameworks provide a structured approach to building UI making codebase easier to understand and maintain.  Bootstrap 5 also has pre-built components like buttons, modals, navbars which have easier accessibility when building UI.

## My Experience of using Bootstrap 5

From my experience of using bootstrap 5 on my assignments, because of little experience I’ve had with HTML and CSS, It took time for me to understand each line.  Doing Island snow assignments helped me to learn the basics and gave me an idea of how to create a website. 
I am still learning how to bring out my desired output and which class to use to acquire that result.  I personally found it hard to correctly align the text because I would have to make the text look evenly spaced out from right to left and top to bottom, and to make it look nicely spaced out when you look at the whole page.  I also found determining the size or height of an image could also be challenging sometimes because there is no right or wrong answer but to determine what size would look most similar.  Bootstrap 5’s pre-built components were pretty easy to use and I learned them and made it easier for me to build UI.

## Conclusion

Learning HTML and CSS was difficult for me and it felt like learning a new programming language from the beginning.  There are still confusing parts to me on how to use some of the HTML elements correctly in different situations but after I was introduced to Bootstrap 5, I was able to have consistency in my code.  Even though Bootstrap 5 helps us to have a consistent, structured approach to building UI and has pre-built components, learning which class to use in each situation so I can have my desired output is still confusing to me and that is why it is important to investigate time and practice until I get used to them.
