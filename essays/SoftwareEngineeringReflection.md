Throughout this Ics314 course, I have come to appreciate the depth and breadth of software engineering, understanding that it involves much more than just writing code for web applications. Functional Programming teaches valuable concepts like immutability and pure functions, which help build predictable, reliable, and scalable systems across various domains such as data science, finance, and concurrent computing. Similarly, Ethics in Software Engineering has deepened my understanding of the moral responsibilities of software engineers. Ethical considerations around privacy, fairness, sustainability, and societal impact are crucial in all types of software development, not just web applications.
By learning about these concepts, I am better equipped to think critically and ethically about the systems I design and develop, ensuring that they are both effective and responsible. Whether in web applications or any other domain, these principles will guide me in making decisions that prioritize human well-being and societal good while advancing technological progress.
