## First weekend of learning Typescript

As someone who’s a complete newbie on Typescript, I was worried since it was a type of programming language I’ve never heard of before and the only programming experience I’ve had was Java.  From my previous experience of Java, Java and TypeScript are both powerful languages but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.  First, their language type is different since Java is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. It's primarily used for server-side development, Android apps, and large enterprise systems while typescript is a statically typed superset of Javascript which adds optional type annotations to Javascript and they are primarily used for client-side web development and can be compiled to Javascript to run in any browser.  Typescript, unlike Java which compiles into bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine, compiles to Javascript and the TypeScript compiler converts TypeScript code into JavaScript.  From a software engineering perspective, I think it's a good programming language because it offers good tooling support for example the autocompletion, code navigation to help enhance developer productivity and code maintainability.  The optional static types and clear interfaces help the code to be easier to understand, and could be of great help when reading large codebases. 

Athletic software engineering for WODS gives me a better understanding of programming giving me an impactful learning experience for me.  Taking the ICS314 course, what I found unique was the practice method we used in our class called WOD.  It was my first time working with WODs and doing some practice WODs at home.  So far I really like how this is taught.  Unlike any previous computer science class I had where there was an assignment I had a whole week to work on with lots of time I had in between, I felt like I was not sure if I was learning enough or if I could really code a language outside of class.  Practicing WODs however helps me to work with good pacing with different varieties of exercise and I could clearly tell whether or not If I was meeting the standard or not.  This alone helped me to review the exercise over and over until I understood the question.  If it wasn’t for WOD and it was just a regular assignment with 7 days to work on, I would have not realized If I understood them fully and continued to not review the question.  WOD is overall very helpful to me and it really makes me feel like my skills are improving.
