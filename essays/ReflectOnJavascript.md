Javascript was a language I only heard of and it is known to be one of the popular languages to learn.  I was thinking about javascript not being too different from java but it turns out to be two completely different languages.  Taking a software engineering course, I am looking forward to learning about this language I only heard about.  

As a complete newbie who started to learn about javascript, I learned that it is different from other programming languages I learned before.  Unlike java or most of the programming languages which need to be compiled before it can run, javascript does not need to be compiled.  Because of this it feels easier and more comfortable to work with javascript.  So far with my knowledge of javascript, javascript looks like a good friendly language for beginners and because of how common it is and how it’s widely used for web development, mobile app, and game development to building web servers it looks like a good programming language from a software engineering perspective as well as athletic software engineering.  

What I found unique was the practice method we used in our class called WOD.  It was my first time working with WODs and doing some practice WODs at home.  So far I really like how this is taught.  Unlike any previous computer science class I had where there was an assignment I had a whole week to work on with lots of time I had in between, I felt like I was not sure if I was learning enough or if I could really code a language outside of class.  Practicing WODs however helps me to work with good pacing with different varieties of exercise and I could clearly tell whether or not If I was meeting the standard or not.  This alone helped me to review the exercise over and over until I understood the question.  If it wasn’t for WOD and it was just a regular assignment with 7 days to work on, I would have not realized If I understood them fully and continued to not review the question.  WOD is overall very helpful to me and it really makes me feel like my skills are improving.
