# Project: Assignment Navigator

# Overview
_The problem_: There are many cases in UH where students ask "when is this assignment due?" and have to constantly log into laulima, click on all individual classes assignement to see the duedate.  There is no convenient way for students to know when their assignement is graded unless they check email constatnly.

_The solution:_ Assignment Navigator is an application designed to help students track their assignment & sees the progress and graded work.
# Approach
There are two roles in this system, users(UH Manoa students) and Admin (Teachers).

students may log in using their UH username and password and they will be able to view all of their assignment and its due date, with all of their previous assignments graded with feedback. 

Admins can monitor the site and update the assignment by creating new post with the due dates, and post the grade with feedback for the assignments that are completed.
# Use case ideas
- User goes to landing page, logs into website using their UH Manoa username and password,
- Admin goes to landing page, logs into the website, add the assignment and its duedate, update on graded assignment and its feedback.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, look through assignment page to see the assignments and their duedate.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, look through graded page to see all the graded work.

# Beyond the basics
Here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Set up a progress indicator where students and teacher can both view their progress on where they are at on the assignment.
- Notify students on SMS or twitter when assignments are added or graded.
- Allow students to reply back on the grade for instructor to see if they are not happy with it.
