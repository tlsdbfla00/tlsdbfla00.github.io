---

Seasonal Paints was a video me and my teammates created in a DNCE course.  I was the director of this project and gave thoughts of showing different dance movements for each different season and my co-director gave the idea of using the paint to express that and we together created a dance video "Seasonal Paint".

Me and my teammates divided the role to select the music which fits each season and who will be doing the dance or film or edit.  After that, me and my assitant-director we together created a shot list and decided on the place, what camera should film, how their movement will be and the camera angle. 

I also took part of filming the movements and editinig the film.  We then played this video at earle ernst lab theatre at UHM for our friends and families.
