I created a 2minute length of dance documentary video.  We were free to choose our own topic and I decided to choose the ongoing film "Are We There Yet, Baby?" at the time I was working on this project.  Because this was my first time creating a documentary video I needed to have basic idea of how to create a good documentary.  What I did first was to look at other documentaries to have a gist on how to make it and then create a shot list of them.  What I noticed from researching was if I don't create a shot list first and went there to just film, it would not result in a good documentary because you are filming whatever you want to.  But after I create my shot list I had ideas of how I wanted to film the particular scene and add ideas to it so by the time I went to their rehersal I was able to film with various camera angles.  

For this Documentary project I arranged an interview with dancer named Anela.  I was able to ask her 5 questions about the film "Are We There Yet, Baby?".  The 4 questions I asked her was "What made you want to dance in this show?", "What is special about this show apart from all the other dance shows?", "Does this show teach a lesson or have a moral?", "What was the hardest part of this performance".  These question was based on what me or any other audience might want to ask the performers.  This was a great experience for me and it helped me to understand the effort into creating one documentary video requires lots of thoughts and research.
