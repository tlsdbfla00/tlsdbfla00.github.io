High school was one of the most challenging times of my life ever since all of my friends from middle school got seperated.  Having english as my second language was challenging for me since it felt like a extra work for me to understand the problem or what the teachers were saying and then solve the actual problem.
With these difficulties I tried my best to overcome my language barrier, constantly asking question to teachers and students when needed.  Overcomming my language problem my grade raise significantly and learning felt exciting.

Having this experience in high school helped me to speak up, ask for questions when needed and raised my confident that I can get good grades and do my best If I try my best.  

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
